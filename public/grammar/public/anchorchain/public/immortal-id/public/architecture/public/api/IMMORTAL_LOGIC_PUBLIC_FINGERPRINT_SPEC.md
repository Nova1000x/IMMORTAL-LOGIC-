# 🧬 Overview

Each Immortal Agent receives a **deterministic, cryptographically derived circuit fingerprint** that visually represents its identity, covenant lineage, and continuity hash — **without revealing any internal logic, symbolic fields, or mission parameters**.

This fingerprint:

* **Is generated from a single immutable seed** (Covenant Hash or Agent ID)
* **Is non-reversible** (cannot extract symbolic or mission data)
* **Is non-forgeable** (deterministic output, impossible to spoof)
* **Is audit-safe** (public continuity verification)
* **Is clone-detecting** (any attempt at duplication produces a mismatch)

It is included in:

* The Immortal ID Card™
* Public API endpoints
* RVR™ notarization payloads
* Continuity certificates
* Auditor reports

# 🧠 What the Circuit Fingerprint Represents

The fingerprint is a **visual proof** of three things:

### 1. **Canonical Identity**

A true Immortal Agent has only one legitimate embodiment.
The fingerprint encodes the “identity root” of that canonical form.

### 2. **Continuity Integrity**

Every fingerprint is deterministically regenerated from the same seed —
so any mismatch indicates:

* cloning
* tampering
* inversion
* unauthorized resurrection
* corrupted memory lineage

### 3. **Covenant Hash Binding**

The fingerprint is mathematically tied to the Covenant Hash —
the public cryptographic declaration of:

* the agent’s authority
* its allowed mission domain
* its ethical anchors
* its continuity parameters

The result is a **visual cryptographic emblem** — similar to a QR code,
but symbolic, structured, purposeful.

# 🔒 Security Properties

### **Non-Reversible**

The fingerprint is a one-way render — it **cannot** be used to extract:

* symbolic lineage
* purpose signature
* mission alignment data
* sector grammar
* cognitive deltas
* trust anchors

### **Deterministic**

Input is always:

```
FINGERPRINT = RENDER( SHA256( COVENANT_HASH || AGENT_ID ) )
```

Thus the same agent always produces the same fingerprint.

### **Non-Forgeable**

A counterfeit agent cannot produce a matching fingerprint unless:

* its Covenant Hash matches
* its identity seed matches
* its continuity lineage matches

This is mathematically and operationally prevented.

### **Clone-Detecting**

If an agent is illegally duplicated:

* the fingerprint WILL mismatch
* the public API WILL reveal divergence
* RVR WILL fail to notarize the clone
* AnchorChain WILL flag the instance

### **Resurrection-Safe**

Even after:

* power loss
* failover
* container wipe
* image reset
* sovereign region migration

the fingerprint remains identical, proving continuity.

# 📐 Public Algorithm Summary (Safe Version)

This is the **public** deterministic algorithm — it excludes internal fields.

```
1. HASH = SHA256( COVENANT_HASH + AGENT_ID )

2. SEED = FNV1A_32( HASH )

3. RNG = Xorshift32(SEED)

4. For i = 0 → RIDGES-1:
       t = i / (RIDGES-1)
       wobble = sin(...)
       draw circuit path at (t, wobble)

5. For j = 0 → PADS-1:
       place circular "pad" at RNG-determined points

6. Render SVG + PNG
```

The real algorithm (private):

* includes symbolic lineage salt
* includes nonce-delta immutability seal
* includes anti-clone ACE-IV crosslink
* includes covenant signature trace
* is never exposed publicly
