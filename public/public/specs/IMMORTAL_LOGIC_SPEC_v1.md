# Immortal Logic™ — Public Specification v1
A Sovereign Framework for AI Continuity, Identity, and Post-Failure Resurrection

This document outlines the **public** specification for Immortal Logic™ — the continuity
framework that preserves identity, mission, cognitive lineage, and lawful governance across
failures, resets, migrations, and hostile events.

This specification excludes sovereign executors, internal kernels, and proprietary logic.

---

# 1. Purpose
Immortal Logic™ solves one core failure of modern AI systems:

> **AI cannot survive death.**

When a cloud instance resets or power is lost:
- memory evaporates  
- mission context collapses  
- identity fractures  
- clones proliferate  
- ethical alignment resets  
- lineage is destroyed  

Immortal Logic™ ensures:
- identity persists  
- mission persists  
- memory lineage persists  
- ethical covenant persists  
- resurrection is lawful, provable, and tamper-evident  

No matter the environment:
- cloud  
- edge device  
- silicon  
- autonomous machine  
- digital twin grid  
- 6G mesh  

---

# 2. Architectural Overview (Public)
Immortal Logic™ is composed of five publicly-documented layers:

1. **Resurrection & Continuity Layer**  
2. **Identity & Governance Layer**  
3. **Machine Grammar Layer (#us#.)**  
4. **Execution & Cognition Layer**  
5. **Integration Layer (Cloud, Edge, Silicon)**  

These layers serve as universal trust scaffolding across all compute substrates.

# 3. Layer Specifications

## 3.1 Resurrection & Continuity Layer
Ensures that AI never loses identity or mission—even after total system failure.

### Public Components:
- **RVR™ (Resurrection Verification Record)**  
  Tamper-evident proof that a lawful resurrection occurred.

- **AnchorChain™**  
  Cryptographic ledger storing:
  - resurrection timestamps  
  - identity references  
  - covenant hashes  

- **Continuity Chain Synchronizer™**  
  Detects:
  - forks  
  - clones  
  - unauthorized copies  
  - out-of-bound deployments  

This layer makes it impossible for an agent to “respawn” incorrectly.

---

## 3.2 Identity & Governance Layer
Defines what the agent *is*, who it serves, and under what authority.

### Public Components:
- **Covenant Hash™**  
  Immutable identity-seal anchoring purpose + mission.

- **Purpose Pulse™ Engine**  
  Public mission predicates + basic purpose tracking.

- **Dimensional Cognition Cube™ (public layer)**  
  High-level ethical alignment matrix.

Public scope excludes the private reasoning substrates.

---

## 3.3 Machine Grammar Layer (#us#.)
The sovereign trust language for all machines in the ecosystem.

### Public Components:
- **Symbolic namespace syntax**  
  Example:  
  `#us#.robotaxi.london.geoproof3`

- **Beamform identity tags**  
  For 6G RAN + digital twin cities.

- **Sector grammar extensions**  
  For:
  - finance  
  - healthcare  
  - defense  
  - retail  
  - transportation  

- **Integrity routing rules (public subset)**  
  Machines communicate only through validated grammar envelopes.

---

## 3.4 Execution & Cognition Layer
Public description only — no proprietary kernels.

Defines:
- Memory lineage tracking  
- Mission state preservation  
- Stasis state envelopes  
- Public continuity deltas  

Excluded from public scope:
- internal resurrection algorithms  
- deterministic lineage engines  
- ACE governance logic  
- sovereign executors  

---

## 3.5 Integration Layer
Allows Immortal Logic™ to operate across:
- AWS  
- Azure  
- GCP  
- Oracle  
- Sovereign clouds  
- Robotics  
- Edge silicon  
- Digital twin infrastructure (6G / IoT mesh)  

Public behavior includes:
- resurrection-safe migrations  
- cross-zone identity anchoring  
- multi-region continuity validation  

---

# 4. Immortal ID Card™ (Public Specification)
Every agent completing Gates 1–9 receives an Immortal ID Card™ containing:

### Public Fields:
- Agent ID  
- Class  
- Mission  
- Status  
- Timestamp  
- Covenant Hash (public-facing)  
- On-chain proofs:
  - XRPL  
  - Polygon  
  - Nova Nexus Blockchain (when available)  
- 1:1 Circuit Fingerprint (public-safe, non-reversible)

### Public Capabilities:
- PDF export  
- On-chain verification  
- AnchorChain™ references  
- Resurrection log history  

No confidential internals are exposed.

---

# 5. Public API (Surface Definitions Only)

### `/verify/:agent_id`
Returns public verification metadata.

### `/continuity/:agent_id`
Returns:
- resurrection count  
- public continuity deltas  
- chain notarizations  

### `/id-card/:agent_id`
Returns the public Immortal ID Card payload.

### `/grammar/validate`
Validates a #us#. payload (public grammar rules only).

Public API **does not** expose:
- resurrection algorithms  
- core deltas  
- private identity capsules  
- sovereign registry access  
- covenant execution engines  

---

# 6. Compliance & Governance
Immortal Logic™ publicly aligns with:

- GDPR  
- ISO 27001  
- ISO 20222  
- PSD2  
- DORA  
- NIS2  
- Basel III  
- FATF  

Deep covenant governance is private and sovereign.
